Firstly all the necessary libraries were imported.
Then the code determines the number of features in the data by getting the number of columns and subtracting 2, which are 'pair' and 'will_merge' columns.
A sequential model is created using Keras Sequential API. This model consists of an input layer with 128 neurons, two hidden layers with 64 and 32 neurons respectively, 
and an output layer with 1 neuron. Between each pair of layers, a dropout layer is added to prevent overfitting by randomly setting a fraction (0.5) of the input units to 0 at each update during training time.
The model is then compiled with a binary cross-entropy loss function, the Adam optimizer, and accuracy as a metric to keep track of during training.
Then i feel that summarising the model was necessary as ,this prints a summary representation of the model.
Callbacks are utility functions applied at given stages of the training procedure. Here two callbacks, ModelCheckpoint and EarlyStopping are defined. 
ModelCheckpoint saves the best model as determined by maximum validation accuracy. EarlyStopping stops training when the validation loss is not improving for a certain number of epochs (patience).
The feature matrix X and the target vector y are defined. X is the data without 'pair' and 'will_merge' columns and y is the 'will_merge' column.
Then the dataset is split into a training set and a test set, with 80% of the data used for training and the remaining 20% for testing.
The model is trained using the training data with a batch size of 32, for a maximum of 100 epochs, though it could stop early if the EarlyStopping condition is met.
Then finally the trained model is evaluated on the test set and the accuracy is printed.
