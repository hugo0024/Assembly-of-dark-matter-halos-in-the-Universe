These are the files we were discussing.

The zlist_TheThreeHundred.txt is the time stamps of the various snapshots
The hlist_0.06270.list etc files are some of the really early complete snapshots

The hlist-0.9710-sample.txt and similar are the top 1000 lines from the
later snapshots.

I can send more data as and when you need it.
